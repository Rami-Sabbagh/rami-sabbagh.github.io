Welcome to the source-files of my personal blogs ðŸ‘‹

## About the website generation

The website is statically generated using [HUGO](https://gohugo.io/) with the nice [Eureka](https://themes.gohugo.io/themes/hugo-eureka/) theme.

## Running locally

Install the latest version of GO, and HUGO.

Clone this repository, and run at the root of it:

```bash
hugo serve -D
```

## Creating a new post

```bash
hugo new posts/YYYY-MM-DD-Post-Title.md
```

For Arabic copy the file manually to `content/ar/posts` and translate it.
