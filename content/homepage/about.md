## Self Introduction

Been programming for almost ~8 years now.
Made my first game at the age of ~13.

Previousely created [LIKO-12](https://github.com/LIKO-12/LIKO-12), an open-source learning environment that felt like old computers, inspired by [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), [Commodore 64](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodore_64) and little bit of [DOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS).

Interested in computers, LEGO, Raspberry Pi, math and some of electronics.
