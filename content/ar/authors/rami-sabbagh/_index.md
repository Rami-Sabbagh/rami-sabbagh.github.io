## Self Introduction

Been programming for almost ~8 years now.
Made my first game at the age of ~13.

Previousely created [LIKO-12](https://github.com/LIKO-12/LIKO-12), an open-source learning environment that felt like old computers, inspired by [PICO-8](https://www.lexaloffle.com/pico-8.php), Commodore 64 and little bit of DOS.

Interested in computers, LEGO, Raspberry Pi, math and electronics.

## About This Blog

This is a **hobby** blog where I _may_ write random posts related to computers and possibly anything electronic.
