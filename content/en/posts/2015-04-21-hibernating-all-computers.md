Hello everyone !

Today I have some good & bad news :)

## Bad News:

Iâ€™m hibernating all my computers until the end of my school tests, They start at 5/5/2015 and end at 15/5/2015 ðŸ˜›

## Good News:

After the test I can work all the week, so PixelizerBox will have alot of updates + It may exit the Prototype Stage !

Also Iâ€™ll have alot of projects :)
