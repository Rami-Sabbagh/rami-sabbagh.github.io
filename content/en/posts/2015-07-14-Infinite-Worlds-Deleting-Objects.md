> **â“˜ Notice:** This is a post from the _childhood archive_. Kept as a reference on my childhood attempts to publish something on the internet. It was originally published using a free hosted Wordpress blog.

I have uploaded a new video to youtube about the new two features: Infinite Worlds + Deleting Objects.
