> **âš  <u>Important</u>: This is a post from the _childhood archive_ which is written back in 2015, when I was ~14 years old (an 8th grade student). As you can notice many of basic problems in their content writing. Read _About Childhood Archive_ for more details on those posts.**

I have uploaded a new video to youtube about the new two features: Infinite Worlds + Deleting Objects.
