Hi Everyone, Today I pushed the first update after a long time :D

You can download it directly from [itch.io](http://ramilego4game.itch.io/pixelizerbox) page.

Now it have a side-menu for choosing object.

And you can now create mods without having to code :) !

You can find a tutorial at “/PixelizerBox/Modding Documentation.txt” and there is an example mod at “/PixelizerBox/Mods/Simple/”.

And you can download the used PhysicsEditor from [Here](https://www.codeandweb.com/physicseditor).
