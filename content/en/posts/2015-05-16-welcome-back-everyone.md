> **âš  <u>Important</u>: This is a post from the _childhood archive_ which is written back in 2015, when I was ~14 years old (an 8th grade student). As you can notice there are many basic problems in their content writing. Read _About Childhood Archive_ for more details on those posts.**

Hey everyone :) , Iâ€™m back, Sorry for being too late :(, But i have some good news !

I started working on CJForge, Itâ€™s an engine upgrade to concerned joe that brings advanced modding to it, The main reason to start it is that Xelu is no longer updating concerned joe, For now iâ€™m only documenting all the files in CJ files, If you want to see what i have done visit [http://github.com/ramilego4game/cjforge/](http://github.com/ramilego4game/cjforge/).

Sorry for not posting updates to Pixelizerbox, But now I have some changes to show :

  I decided to create a new options menu to replace the 2 frames, Itâ€™s still under coding, But you can see what I have done :

As you see now there is a toolbar at the top that haves 4 button, And a Menu that is toggle-able, For now you see only the objects menu, But then Iâ€™ll add objects options (Like: Static, Bouncy, Density, Mass, etcâ€¦..), I wish I may release this update maybe after 3 days.

Thatâ€™s all for today, See you tomorrow ðŸ˜€
