Hello everyone, I haven’t been active for some time, But now i’m back :)

After some upgrades and rewriting some files, The engine of the game is now able to jump over the prototype stage, Because of that I’m afraid, I have to pass on it :(

Before I decided to pass on prototype stage, I had some work done on the sandbox (not and won’t be complete) which you can see in the featured video.

Now I started working on the level editor, Screenshots and videos are coming soon !
